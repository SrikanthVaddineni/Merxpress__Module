Shopping Cart Module: This module enables users to add products to their shopping cart, inspect the contents of their cart, and handle the checkout process. Order total computation, delivery options, and payment processing should all be included. i need code in python
I'll provide you with a simplified example of a shopping cart module.
This example will focus on the core functionality of adding products to the cart, viewing the cart contents, computing the order total, and checking out. Please note that a real-world implementation would involve more robust error handling, database integration for storing products, and security measures for payment processing.
In this example:
1.We define a Product class to represent products with a name and a price.
2.We create a ShoppingCart class to manage the cart's items.
3.The add_item method adds products to the cart with an optional quantity.
4.The view_cart method displays the items in the cart.
5.The compute_order_total method calculates the total cost of the items in the cart.
6.The checkout method simulates the checkout process, asking for a payment method and confirming the order.
7.The remove_item method allows you to remove items from the cart, and if the quantity goes to zero, it removes the item from the cart entirely.
8.The checkout method now asks for shipping information and simulates payment processing. If the user confirms the order, it clears the cart; otherwise, it leaves the items in the cart.

Feel free to customize and expand upon this code as needed for your specific requirements.
